# Simple Shell

This is a project for a simple shell for the Machine Learning course at Holberton School.

## Description

This shell is a basic implementation of a command line interface that allows the user to execute built-in and external commands. The shell also includes the ability to redirect input and output, as well as handle background process execution.

## Usage

To use the shell, simply compile the source code and execute the resulting program. Here's an example of how to compile the source code on Linux:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh


Once compiled, the program can be run by typing the following command:

$ ./hsh


Here are some examples of how to use the shell:

$ ls
$ cd /home
$ echo "Hello, world!"
$ exit
